The paper is a bit convoluted to follow because they switch seamlessly between code and pseudocode, along with between types, instances, and unique identifiers. Plus, there are minor inconsistencies which interfere with locally building up a global understanding of the paper.

The plan is to copy-paste any algorithms/pseudocode/..., add type information, reify any inconsistencies, and then transliterate that to Zig.
